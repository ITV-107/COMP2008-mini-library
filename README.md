# COMP2008-mini-library
A set of small standalone utility functions which I can import and clone without having to import the C++ standard library (which is huge)
This is especially useful for embedded systems, which have a small amount of memory and slower CPUs.

These are also written in pure C++ without any libraries, allowing them to be compiled by anything which has a C++ compiler.
